# Server

Based on php-wss, creates a websocket server that answers client requests and keeps state synchronized between them. As much as possible, the server tries to be renderer agnostic. For distances and speed it uses a generic unit, being analagous to one tile's width and height, instead of pixels.

Run using php ws_server.php in a terminal.
